# Airbnb Analysis Project - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas and create an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize key insights. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends within the Airbnb listings data. Through interactive visualizations, users can explore and understand the dynamics of the Airbnb market, enabling informed decision-making for property management and tourism.

## Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes the following key features:

### **Home Page:**
   - Provides overview, About and skills takeaway from the project 

### **Basic Insights Page:**

In the Basic Insights Page of the Power BI dashboard, you'll find the following key metrics displayed through card visualizations:

1. **Number of Listings:** Total count of Airbnb listings.
2. **Total Revenue:** Total revenue generated from all listings.
3. **Average Ratings:** Average rating across all listings.
4. **Total Beds:** Total number of beds available in all listings.
5. **Total Bedrooms:** Total number of bedrooms across all listings.
6. **Extra People Fees:** Total extra fees collected from all listings for additional guests.
7. **Maximum Guests Included:** Maximum number of guests included in any listing.


### **Host Analysis Page:**

In the Host Analysis Page of the Power BI dashboard, several visualizations are included to provide insights into host performance and guest satisfaction:

 1. Filter by Host Name:

A slicer visualization allows users to filter the data displayed on the Host Analysis Page by host name. Users can select one or multiple host names from the slicer, and the data visualizations on the page will dynamically update to reflect the chosen selection. This enables users to focus on specific hosts and analyze their performance metrics, such as the number of listings, average ratings, revenue generated, and other relevant insights.

2. Review Scores by Bed Type, Room Type, and Price:

A stacked column chart is utilized to display the distribution of review scores across different combinations of bed type, room type, and price ranges. Each column in the chart represents a specific combination, with segments stacked on top of each other representing different review score categories (e.g., excellent, good, average, poor). The height of each segment within a column corresponds to the proportion of listings falling into that category.


### **Location Analysis Page:**

In the Location Analysis Page of the Power BI dashboard, various visualizations are included to provide insights into Airbnb listings across different countries:

1. Guest Included Countrywise - Treemap:
A treemap visualization is used to display the distribution of the maximum number of guests included in Airbnb listings across different countries. Each rectangle within the treemap represents a country, and the size of the rectangle corresponds to the total number of guests included in listings from that country. This visualization allows users to quickly identify countries with the highest and lowest numbers of guests included in Airbnb listings.

2. Latitude and Longitude Map:
A map visualization is utilized to plot the latitude and longitude coordinates of Airbnb listings. Each point on the map represents an individual listing, with color coding or clustering applied to visualize density. This map provides a geographical perspective of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore their distribution across different regions and identify areas with high listing concentrations.

3. Maximum Price Using Gauge:
A gauge visualization is employed to display the maximum price among Airbnb listings. The gauge provides a visual indication of the maximum price, allowing users to quickly assess the highest price point within the dataset.

4. Price and Total Revenue by Country - Line Chart:
A line chart visualization is used to compare the average price and total revenue generated by Airbnb listings across different countries over time. Each line on the chart represents a country, and users can interactively explore price and revenue trends by selecting specific countries or time periods. This visualization enables users to identify countries with high average prices and revenue contributions, facilitating strategic decision-making for property management and investment.
